# F12023_Predictive_Analysis
Creating probability distribution for the top 6 drivers of 2022 F1 season and then predicting various scenarios for the first two races, i.e. The Bahrain Grand Prix and the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, based on the 2022 seasons final standings.

The Questions answered are:
- Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win the Bahrain Grand Prix?
- What is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win both the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grand Prix?
- What is the probability for Ferrari to win both races?
- What is the probability for Ferrari to win at least one race?
- If Ferrari wins the first race, what is the probability that Ferrari wins the next one?
- If Ferrari wins at least one of these two races, what is the probability Ferrari wins both races?
- How about Red Bull and Mercedes?
- Ferrari wins one of these two races on a rainy day. What is the probability Ferrari wins both races, assuming races can be held on either rainy, sunny, cloudy, snowy or foggy days?

Note: All probabilities are determined based on the final points and standings previous F1 season(2022). Also, the probability distribution only takes into account the top 6 drivers from previous F1 season(2022). The probability distribution for weather conditions in the final question takes into account 5 weather conditions - Rain, Sun, Clouds, Snow and Fog, each having the same probability of 1/5.
